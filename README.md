The John Siavash Public Health firm has the mission to promote healthy lifestyles in the United States. Jisu, Wendell, Nguyen, and Don'Yelle are employees assigned to a task force reviewing the Body Mass Index (BMI), Caloric Intake, and Physical Activity. The task force has pulled global data information for the countries: Niger, the Central African Republic, Congo, and the United States.  

Body Mass Index is a person's weight in kilograms (or pounds) divided by the square of height in meters (or feet). A high BMI can indicate high body fat. BMI screens for weight categories that may lead to health problems, but it does not diagnose an individual's body fatness or health.

A calorie is a unit that is used to measure energy. Calories provide power in the form of heat so our bodies can function. While calories are essential to our daily lives, monitoring the appropriate number of calories one consumes is vital.

The World Health Organization defines physical activity as any bodily movement produced by skeletal muscles that require energy expenditure. Physical activity refers to all movement, including during leisure time, for transport to and from places or as part of a person's work. Both moderate- and vigorous-intensity physical activity improve health.

The end goal of the task force is to encourage Americans to improve their BMI. The task force believes that the objective can be achieved by increasing physical activity and decreasing caloric intake.  

Extract:
•	Extracted BMI table from CDC website 
•	Downloaded obesity data for OUR world website 
•	Pulled Caloric intake and physical activity data from WHO website
Transform:
•	Cleaned data in Pandas in Jupyter Notebook 
•	Rearranged columns to match SQL data in Postgres
Load: Exported the csv files into Postgres SQL 
•	SQL database was chosen because the task force wanted a more structure database presentation.
